# README

The main file, `margins.r`, shows how to compute Stata-like margins in
R by hand. It's mostly just to show the intuition underlying Stata's
`-margins-` commands, but one can use the underlying results to make
nice margins figures with ggplot.

For a fuller suite of ready-to-go commands, there's the
`[margins](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/margins/vignettes/Introduction.html)`
R package.
